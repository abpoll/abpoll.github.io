Neglecting uncertainty can bias decisions with far-reaching impacts on socioeconomic, engineered, and Earths systems. A substantial portion of my research focuses on uncertainty characterization and quantification in multisector systems. This research is grounded in decision-making contexts. For example, I aim to represent how flood risk estimation or valuation techniques that underlie current decision-making and research tasks compare to methods with better uncertainty characterization.
