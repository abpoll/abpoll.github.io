Neglecting uncertainty can bias decisions with far-reaching impacts on socioeconomic, engineered, and Earths systems. A substantial portion of my research focuses on uncertainty characterization and quantification in flood risk estimation. This research is grounded in decision-making contexts. As such, I aim to represent how flood risk estimation techniques that underly current decision-making tasks compare to methods with better uncertainty characterization.
