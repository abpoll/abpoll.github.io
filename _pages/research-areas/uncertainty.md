Neglecting uncertainty can bias decisions with far-reaching impacts on socioeconomic, engineered, and Earths systems. A substantial portion of my research focuses on uncertainty characterization and quantification in multisector systems. This research is grounded in decision-making contexts. For example, I aim to represent how flood risk estimation or valuation techniques that underlie current decision-making and research tasks compare to methods with better uncertainty characterization. My current research on this topic is funded under the [Integrated Coastal Modeling](https://icom.pnnl.gov/) project in which I am working with a large interdisciplinary team to better understand how to represent uncertainty in hazard modeling, structure inventory datasets, and hazard-damage fragility curves. Ultimately, these efforts serve to improve methods for policy and decision support.
