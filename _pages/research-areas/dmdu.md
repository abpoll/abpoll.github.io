Decisions about climate risk management are complex for a number of vexing issues. I am most interested in how risk management decisions can be made robustly with respect to ambiguous system boundaries and standards for defining success. I believe that [convergence research practices](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/learn/research-types/learn-about-convergence-research#definition) offer a way forward for producing useful and actionable climate science. To this end, I conduct research at the intersection of values & ethics and decision making under deep uncertainty. In this research, I utilize values-informed mental models of a problem system in order to assess whether strategies under consideration are robust to a potentially diverse set of values from affected parties. The majority of my research within this area is funded under the [Megalopolitan Coastal Transformation Hub](https://coastalhub.org/focus-areas/) in which I am lead analyst on the decision-analysis team and work closely with members of the hazards, values and ethics, human system dynamics, and stakeholder engagement teams.
