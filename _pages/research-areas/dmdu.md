Decisions about climate risk management are complex for a number of vexing issues. I am most interested in how risk management decisions can be made robustly with respect to ambiguous ambiguous system boundaries and standards for defining success. I conduct research on flood risk management decisions, such as rules for equitably allocating mitigation grant funds, at the intersection of values and ethics and decision making under deep uncertainty. In this research, I utilize participant-informed conceptual models of a decision problem in order to assess whether strategies under consideration are robust to a potentially diverse set of values from affected parties. The majority of my research within this area is funded under the [Megalopolitan Coastal Transformation Hub](https://coastalhub.org/focus-areas/) in which I am lead analyst on the decision-analysis team and work closely with members of the hazards, values and ethics, human system dynamics, and stakeholder engagement teams.
