A large portion of a person's well-being comes from where they live and work. Therefore, because flooding is the most widesly experienced, costly, and deadly natural disaster in many areas around the world, it is important to understand the nature of flood risk in housing markets and the policies and decisions that are effective in managing these risks. This is a challenging area of study because physical flood risks arise from a complex system of private preferences and decisions, public policies and investments, and feedbacks between human, built, and natural systems. In addition, physical flood risks are directly connected to fiscal risks across society through interactions between housing markets, insurance providers, financial institutions, and public policy. My research focuses on several aspects of these complex issues in a U.S. policy context with the aim of providing actionable insights for decision-makers about policy levers at their disposal and scientific insights for researchers to improve how we study important research questions.
