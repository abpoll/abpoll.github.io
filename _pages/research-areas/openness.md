 Transparent and [reproducible research](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/25303/chapter/1) is a foundation of producing useful and robust knowledge. I am committed to learning about best practices for transparent and reproducible science, incorporating these into my workflows, and advocating for widespread, strong standards to improve the state of climate change research. In one strand of work, I study the sensitivity of research findings to analyst decisions about data processing and computational modeling implementation. In a related focus, I work within an interdisciplinary group that is trying to identify best practices in being transparent about conceptual models of study systems. My overarching goal is to ensure that climate change research practices evolve with the state of the art in producing usable, actiononable, and robust knowledge that decision-makers can readily draw from to address the challenges they face.
