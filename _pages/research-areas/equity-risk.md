I want my research to be useful, which is hard because "the search for scientific bases for confronting problems of social policy is bound to fail" ([Rittel and Webber, 1973](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01405730)). While "Dilemmas in a general theory of planning" is one of my favorite papers, I don't take the same doomer view as the authors -- some failure is much worse than others. For example, I think science can do a much better job at informing what it means for a process or outcome to be equitable and how to represent equity in quantitative analyses. My research on wicked problems has primarily focused on the challenge that there is no single definition of equity. I think about the wicked problem framing often, and try to overcome the wickedness of problems related to climate risks in much of my research.
