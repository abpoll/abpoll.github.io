Equity is invoked widely in the context of climate risk management. I'm interested in what it means for a process or outcome to be equitable and how to represent equity in decision analyses. My research in this area focuses on how equity is defined and measured in different social contexts and which policies are robust to different ways of thinking about equity. To this end, I led a review paper on how equity is defined and measured in flood risk research to identify practices for defining useful equity measurements in a number of related management settings. Relatedly, I lead the equity and deep uncertainty in benefit cost analysis working group in the the [Megalopolitan Coastal Transformation Hub](https://coastalhub.org/focus-areas/). In this line of work, I collaborate with members of the hazards, values and ethics, human system dynamics, and stakeholder engagement teams in order to evaluate how current federal rules for flood mitigation grant funding can be reformed to better achieve current policy objectives, such as economic efficiency, and stakeholder objectives, such as equity.
