Risk management is complex for a number of vexing issues. I am most interested in how risk management decisions can robustly meet objectives in the face of ambiguous system boundaries and standards for defining success. I believe that convergence research practices offer a way forward for producing useful and actionable risk science. To this end, I conduct use-driven research at the intersection of values & ethics and decision making under deep uncertainty. For example, I led research on the U.S. government's one-size-fits-all approach in implementing the Justice40 Initiative, which aimed to promote equity across individuals in flood-risk reduction funding. Meeting this normative goal is not trivial, and we identified funding rules that outperform the government's implementation of Justice40 in meeting its stated objectives. I am always looking for co-production partners across sectors and fields to help guide my decision analysis research and increase the probability that our collaborative findings inform real-world decisions.
