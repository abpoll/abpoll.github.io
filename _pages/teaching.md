* At Boston University, I was the lab instructor for EE 270, "Data, Models, and Analysis in Earth & Environment", an introductory probability and statistics course for natural and social science applications in environmental sciences, in Spring 2020 and 2021.
* At Stony Brook University, I was a teaching assistant for CSE 316, "Software Development Fundamentals." In this role, I held 4 open office hours per week where I assisted students on course projects through concept review, implementation advice, and debugging help.
