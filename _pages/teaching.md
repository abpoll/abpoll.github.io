* At University of Iowa, I will teach a course on Environmental Justice at the School of Earth, Environment, and Sustainability, starting in Spring 2026. 
* At Dartmouth College, I developed a teaching module on how to produce Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable analyses, which I presented in the course Bayesian Statistical Modeling and Computation in the winters of 2024 and 2025. I developed a course called "Decision Analysis for Wicked Climate Problems," which I will teach as a special topics course in the Fall 2025 term.
* At Boston University, I was the lab instructor for EE 270, "Data, Models, and Analysis in Earth & Environment", an introductory probability and statistics course for natural and social science applications in environmental sciences, in Spring 2020 and 2021.
* At Stony Brook University, I was a teaching assistant for CSE 316, "Software Development Fundamentals." In this role, I held 4 open office hours per week where I assisted students on course projects through concept review, implementation advice, and debugging help.
