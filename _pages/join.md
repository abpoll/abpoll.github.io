I am currently recruiting PhD students for Fall 2026 to join me at the School of Earth, Environment, and Sustainability (SEES). The position will be fully funded. The University of Iowa PhD application deadline is December 1, 2025. Applicants must submit a CV, statement of purpose, three letters of recommendation, and transcripts. You can learn more [here](https://sees.uiowa.edu/graduate/admissions). You can apply to the SEES program without contacting me ahead of time, but I highly recommend you email me in advance to express your interest. Following these steps will help us identify whether the PhD opportunity is a good mutual fit, in which case I will ensure that your application receives priority: 

1. Read [example publications](https://abpoll.github.io/publications/). Note the mix of techniques from statistics, economics, and data science, as well as my recent attention to integrating normative and philosophical considerations into quantitative decision analysis. 
2. Review the [core values](https://keller-lab.github.io/web-manual/docs/lab-values/) I hold for research and check that these resonate with you. 
3. If you do steps 1 & 2 and think you see a good fit, email me at <adam-pollack@uiowa.edu>:
    * Include relevant documents (e.g., a current CV, a draft of your personal statement, any relevant prior work you'd like me to see)
    * Explain why you are reaching out to me specifically (e.g., did you read one of my papers?). An inquiry that references a specific paper or idea (doesn't have to be one of mine!) and ties it to your interests and what you hope to gain as a member of the group is the most likely to receive a positive response. 
    * Be yourself! I get a lot of similar sounding inquiries. I don't mind if you use a LLM to polish your writing, but if you rely on one to generate content there's a good chance I won't see your interest as genuine. It's important to check your writing for spelling, grammar, flow, etc., but at this stage, the best way to stand out is to be your awesome, unique self!
4. Video chat
    * If we have a good exchange of ideas over email, we will meet for a video chat. We will address any questions you have, then talk about research interests and ideas. The goal is to sketch out what the perfect PhD looks like for you and provide you with an honest assessment of what the PhD could look like at Iowa under my supervision so you can make an informed decision.
    * This will not be a formal interview. There is no need for a fancy background, formal dress-up, etc.,
    * I will give you contact information for students I have advised and worked with so you can learn more about my mentorship style, research culture, etc., 
5. Your application
    * To convince the application reviewers that you would be happy and successful if you joined the group, your application should answer the following questions:
      * Would pursuing this degree and doing research in the group advance **your** career *and* life goals?
      * What experience demonstrates that you have the required skills to successfully carry out research in our group? 
      * What skills and experiences do you lack, and how will you obtain them during your graduate education? 
      * Why is Adam the right supervisor for you?
