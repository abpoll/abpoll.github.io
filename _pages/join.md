I am currently recruiting PhD students for Fall 2026 to join me at the School of Earth, Environment, and Sustainability (SEES). The position will be fully funded. The University of Iowa PhD application deadline is December 1, 2025. Applicants must submit a CV, statement of purpose, three letters of recommendation, and transcripts. You can learn more [here](https://sees.uiowa.edu/graduate/admissions). You can apply to the SEES program without contacting me ahead of time, but I highly recommend you email me in advance to express your interest and ensure that your application receives priority if we determine a good mutual fit. I consider the choice of PhD advisor as the most important decision for a PhD, and very important for one's overall career. This is a decision that should be guided by the potential for a good mutual fit, which is not something we can tell without some time getting to know each other. With the goal of helping both of us determine fit on a relatively short time span, if you are interested in joining the lab, I will support applicants who follow these steps: 

1. Read [example publications](https://abpoll.github.io/publications/).
2. Review the [core values](https://keller-lab.github.io/web-manual/docs/lab-values/) I hold for research. 
3. If you do steps 1 & 2 and think you see a good fit, email me at <adam-pollack@uiowa.edu> with the following:
    * Include relevant documents (e.g., a current CV, a draft of your personal statement, any relevant prior work you'd like me to see)
    * Explain why you are reaching out to me specifically (e.g., did you read one of my papers?). An inquiry that references a specific paper or idea and ties it to your interests and what you hope to gain as a member of the group is the msot likely to receive a positive response. 
    * Ask specific questions. If your expression of interest is vague, I may not respond to you. By asking questions like "Are you still working on `<this topic>`", I am more likely to take your interest as genuine.
    * Be prepared to iterate via email.
4. Video chat
    * If we determine strong mutual fit over email, we will meet for a video chat. The goal is to evaluate your verbal communication skills and how you articulate your interests. This will not be a formal interview - it helps to ensure that we get along well enough to suggest a productive mentorship relationship. 
    * There is no need for a fancy background, formal dress-up, etc.,
5. Guided paper evaluation
    * If we continue to find strong mutual fit, I will send you an email asking you to provide a written evaluation of two papers that most closely correspond to the interests you articulate in the video chat.
    * The goal is to get a sense of your baseline writing skills, ability to synthesize research findings, and research framing experience. This is also synergistic with your statement of purpose. Your task is to report the following in one page (12 point font, times new roman):
      * What question do the studies address?
      * How do they address the question?
      * What do the studies find?
      * What are strengths and weaknesses? 
      * How would you improve on the studies?
6. Your application
    * To convince the application reviewers that you would be happy and successful if you joined the group, your application should answer the following questions:
      * Would pursuing this degree and doing research in the group advance **your** career *and* life goals?
      * What experience demonstrates that you have the required skills to successfully carry out research in our group? 
      * What skills and experiences do you lack, and how will you obtain them during your graduate education? 
      * Why is Adam the right supervisor for you?
