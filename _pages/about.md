I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Keller Lab Group](https://keller-lab.github.io/) in the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College. My research focuses on natural disaster risk management and is motivated by, and responsive to, the concerns and values of affected parties and decision-makers. I pursue research questions that can offer actionable insights for public policy and decision-centered academic research practices, particularly in U.S. flood risk management.

I completed my Ph.D. in the Earth and Environment Department at Boston University under the supervision of [Christoph Nolte](https://placeslab.org/) and [Ian Sue Wing](https://people.bu.edu/isw/). I earned my B.S. and M.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Stony Brook University.

Throughout most of my tenure at Stony Brook University, I operated [Long Island Kettle Corn](https://patch.com/new-york/portwashington/three-minutes-across-counter-long-island-kettle-corn) at farmer's markets and fairs throughout Long Island, New York. When I moved to Boston, I continued my food-based moonlighting by volunteering at the (now defunct) Appleton Farms cheese both at the Boston Public Market. If you are ever in a situation where you have to choose between kettle corn and cheese, I recommend the latter.
