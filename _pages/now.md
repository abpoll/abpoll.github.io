This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about); I can't promise how up-to-date it is, but I try to update it when anything major happens!

## Research Ideas I'm Thinking About

This list is not identical to what I'm currently working on, but it's a good reflection of that plus what I'm thinking about myself or with collaborators.

- Measuring the value of data and model refinements for decision making;
- Probabilistic depth-damage relationships and implications for flood risk assessment;
- Identifying sound and helpful ways to represent compound flooding;
- Open-source and interoperable multi-hazard risk assessment frameworks;
- Integrating political economy into decision analysis framing and modeling; 
- Long-term co-production partnerships for decision-oriented research ideas.

## Career Things I'm Thinking About
- **I'm recruiting PhD students**. If you are interested in joining me at the Schol of Earth, Environment, and Sustainability at the University of Iowa, please see the following [application workflow](/files/pdf/application_workflow.pdf)
- I'm very excited to teach a course I developed on decision analysis for wicked climate problems
- I'm developing a course on Environmental Justice for the School of Earth, Environment, and Sustainability 
- I will eventually find the time to move this website over to Quarto and separately set up a lab group webpage and manual!
