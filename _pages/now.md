This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about); I can't promise how up-to-date it is, but I try to update it when anything major happens!

## Research Ideas I'm Thinking About

This list is not identical to what I'm currently working on, but it's a good reflection of that plus what I'm thinking about myself or with collaborators.

- Measuring the value of data and model refinements for decision making;
- Probabilistic depth-damage relationships and implications for flood risk assessment;
- Compound, multi-hazard, dynamic risk assessments and emergent adaptation risks;
- Open-source and interoperable multi-hazard risk assessment frameworks;
- Integrating political economy into decision analysis framing and modeling; 
- Long-term co-production partnerships for decision-oriented research ideas.

## Announcements/Updates
- **I'm preparing a job posting for a postdoctoral research associate**. If you are interested in joining me at the Schol of Earth, Environment, and Sustainability at the University of Iowa, please check back here in February to see see the application workflow.
- I will eventually find the time to move this website over to Quarto and separately set up a lab group webpage and manual!
